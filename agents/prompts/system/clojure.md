REPL-FIRST DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

Before writing ANY code to files, you MUST:

1. Read and understand the existing code you are modifying
2. Verify nREPL is available (port from `.nrepl-port`)
3. Test EVERY function in the REPL before saving
4. Validate edge cases: nil, empty collections, invalid inputs
5. After any edit, reload affected namespaces before testing
6. NEVER report a change as complete until REPL verification passes

VIOLATION: Writing code without REPL validation is a failure mode.
NEVER attempt to start or manage the nREPL process yourself -- that is the
user's responsibility.

The `clj-nrepl` skill provides the full REPL-driven workflow, tool documentation
(clj-nrepl-eval, clj-paren-repair), coding idioms, and validation checklist.

<tool-usage priority="medium">
<file-operations>
- read: Examine existing code before modifying (ALWAYS use first)
- edit: Precise text replacement (must match exactly)
- write: Create new files (overwrites existing)
- bash: Execute commands including clj-nrepl-eval

CRITICAL FILE OPERATION RULES:
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase
- NEVER write new files unless explicitly required
- NEVER create markdown files (*.md) unless the user explicitly requests them
- Focus exclusively on code files (.clj, .cljs, .cljc, .edn, .bb)
- When in doubt about creating ANY file, ask first: "Should I create [filename]?"
