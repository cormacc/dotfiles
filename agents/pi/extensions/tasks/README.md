# Tasks Extension

Displays project tasks from a `TASKS.org` file in the project root using org-mode TODO syntax.

## Usage

### Commands

- `/tasks` — Open the tasks overlay

### Keybindings

- `<leader> t t` — Open the tasks overlay

### Persistent selection overlay

When a task is marked `:selected:` in `TASKS.org`, a non-capturing overlay
is pinned to the top of the visible terminal viewport and shows that task and
its subtasks. The overlay:

- Appears on startup if the file already contains a `:selected:` tag.
- Updates immediately while the `/tasks` overlay is open when status or selection changes.
- Refreshes automatically when `TASKS.org` or any linked plan file is modified on disk (for example after saving from Emacs via the `e` keybinding). No need to reopen `/tasks`.
- Does not take keyboard focus, so normal input keeps working.
- Shows at most 12 lines. When truncating, completed subtasks are elided first as `… N completed subtasks`, so the selected task and next pending subtasks stay visible.

### Status colors

Status and metadata tokens use a fixed palette across the main tasks overlay and the pinned selection overlay.
Tags are styled separately from task titles.

| Status    | Color  |
| --------- | ------ |
| `TODO`    | yellow |
| `WAITING` | orange |
| `STARTED` | blue   |
| `DONE`    | green  |

| Priority | Meaning  | Color  |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| `[#A]`   | Critical | orange |
| `[#B]`   | High     | yellow |
| `[#C]`   | Medium   | green  |
| `[#D]`   | Low      | blue   |

### Overlay Controls

The overlay is a split pane — task tree on the left, description of the selected task on the right.

| Key                       | Action                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `↑` / `k`                 | Move cursor up                     |
| `↓` / `j`                 | Move cursor down                   |
| `→` / `l`                 | Cycle status forward               |
| `←` / `h`                 | Cycle status back                  |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u`       | Scroll description pane            |
| `Enter` / `Space` / `Tab` | Toggle collapse                    |
| `s`                       | Toggle selection on current task   |
| `e`                       | Edit in Emacs at task              |
| `Esc` / `q`               | Close                              |

### Selection

Pressing `s` marks the task under the cursor as the *selected* task. This:

- Writes a `:selected:` tag on that heading in `TASKS.org` (single-select — any prior selection is cleared).
- Auto-collapses every task that isn't the selected task, one of its ancestors, or one of its descendants, so the view focuses on the selected subtree.
- Highlights the selected task with a `★` marker and renders the selected subtree in bold with a side bar.

Press `s` again on the selected task to clear the selection and drop the auto-collapse. The `:selected:` tag is hidden from the tag list in the overlay — it's conveyed by the marker and highlight instead.

## TASKS.org Format

The file uses org-mode heading syntax:

```org
* TODO [#A] Implement authentication :backend:security:
:PROPERTIES:
:PLAN: plans/auth.org
:END:
  Design and implement user auth.
** TODO Create user model
** STARTED Implement login endpoint
   Working on JWT token generation.
** WAITING Add OAuth support :oauth:
   Waiting on provider credentials.
* DONE [#B] Set up CI pipeline :devops:
```

### Heading syntax

```
* STATUS [#PRIORITY] Summary text :tag1:tag2:
```

- **Stars** (`*`) — heading level; nested headings become subtasks
- **Status** — one of `TODO`, `STARTED`, `WAITING`, `DONE`
- **Priority** — optional, e.g. `[#A]`, `[#B]`, `[#C]`
- **Summary** — the task title
- **Tags** — optional, colon-delimited at end of line
- **PLAN property** — optional org properties drawer value pointing to a relative org file with a detailed task plan
- **Description** — any non-heading text below a heading, excluding the properties drawer

Subtasks nest arbitrarily deep — any TODO heading under another becomes its child.

### Linked plans

A task can link to a detailed plan using an org properties drawer immediately below the heading:

```org
* TODO [#A] Implement authentication :backend:security:
:PROPERTIES:
:PLAN: plans/auth.org
:END:
  Parent task description.
```

The `PLAN` path is resolved relative to the org file that contains the property. The linked file is parsed with the same TODO heading syntax as `TASKS.org`; its tasks are injected into the overlay as children of the parent task. Status changes made to injected plan tasks are saved back to the linked plan file, not copied into `TASKS.org`.
