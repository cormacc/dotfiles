  Capture friction with agent / pi configuration (AGENTS.md, skills, prompts,
  pi extensions, project conventions) at the moment it arises in any session
  and route it as actionable TODO work to the right tier — project-local
  config goes into the current project's TASKS.org; global config (managed
  in ~/dotfiles) goes into the dotfiles repo's TASKS.org via pi-intercom.
  Use whenever the user (or you yourself) notices something durable that
  should change about how the agent works.

# Self-improvement skill

This skill turns observed friction into durable work items. It does
*not* edit `AGENTS.md`, skill files, prompts, or extensions
directly — every change goes through a normal TODO entry, optionally
promoted into a change-record via the [`org-plan`](../org-plan/SKILL.md)
flow, so the team and the project history stay in the loop.

The skill is repo-agnostic. It is invoked from whichever session
notices the friction, and routes the resulting TODO to the tier that
owns the affected artefact.

## When to use

### User-invoked

Whenever the user says things like "let's capture that as a
self-improvement", "feed this back into the skill", "remember this
for next time", or otherwise asks to log a durable lesson about
agent behaviour or config.

### Agent-invoked (self-proposal)

Invoke this skill *proactively* when one of these is observed:

- The user corrects an action that traces back to an explicit
  `AGENTS.md` or skill guideline — the rule clearly didn't land.
- A tool was misused in a way rooted in unclear or missing
  documentation, and the same mistake is plausibly repeatable.
- A protocol gap is discovered (a workflow the agent had to
  improvise because nothing in `AGENTS.md` / skills covered it).
- The agent had to ask the user for information that *should*
  have been answered by existing config.

Keep the heuristic narrow. Do *not* self-propose for one-off
mistakes, taste disagreements, or ordinary user direction
changes. When unsure, ask the user once whether to log it; their
answer is itself a useful signal.

## Routing: project-local vs dotfiles-global

Before doing anything else, classify the affected artefact's
*tier*. The TODO must end up in the `TASKS.org` of the repo that
owns the fix.

### Decision rules

| Signal | Tier |
|--------|------|
| Affected file resolves under `$HOME/dotfiles` | global |
| Affected file resolves under `~/.agents/` or `~/.pi/agent/` (these are symlinks into dotfiles via `agents.nix`) | global |
| Affected artefact is a skill, pi extension, prompt, or `AGENTS.md` shipped from dotfiles | global |
| Affected artefact is a project-only `AGENTS.md`, project-scoped script, project-specific convention, or project tooling | project-local |
| Affected artefact lives in a sibling repo unrelated to dotfiles or the current project | project-local *to that repo* — but routing to a third repo is out of scope; ask the user |

When in doubt, run `realpath` on the affected file and check
whether it resolves into `$HOME/dotfiles`. The `~/.agents` and
`~/.pi/agent` paths are symlinks; the destination matters, not
the source.

### Ambiguous cases

If the classification isn't clear from the signals above, ask the
user once: *"is this a fix in this project, or in your dotfiles?"*
If they decline to disambiguate, default to the **current
project** (least disruptive) and add the tag `:tier-unknown:` to
the entry so it can be re-routed later.

## Two flows

The routing decision selects one of two flows. Triage logic
(classify affected target, dedupe, draft entry, confirm, insert,
prompt) is identical between them — only the *transport* differs.

### Flow A: project-local (no transport)

1. Collect a free-form description of the friction. If you are
   self-proposing, write it yourself and mark sender as `agent`.
   If the user is invoking, take their description and mark
   sender as `human`.
2. Auto-detect metadata:
   - Origin session name (via `intercom action: status` or
     equivalent).
   - `cwd`.
   - Git remote and current branch
     (`git remote get-url origin`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`).
   - Timestamp via `date +'%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M'`.
   - Optional transcript snippet showing the trigger, if useful.
3. Triage (see "Triage routine" below).
4. Insert into the *current project's* `TASKS.org` via
   `tasks_insert_task` with section `Agent feedback` and
   `allowCreateSection: true`.
5. Tell the user: *"Filed as <UUID> under * Agent feedback. Plan
   it now (org-plan) or leave on the backlog?"* and act on their
   answer.

### Flow B: dotfiles-global (pi-intercom hand-off)

The originating session does *not* triage; it hands a structured
envelope to a session running in the dotfiles repo.

1. Collect description + auto-detect metadata (as in Flow A,
   step 2).
2. Discover a live dotfiles session:
   ```
   intercom action: list
   ```
   Filter for a session whose `cwd` is under `$HOME/dotfiles`.
3. If none is alive, **auto-spawn** one (see "Spawn recipe"
   below) and wait for it to register with intercom.
4. Send the envelope (fire-and-forget, *not* `ask`):
   ```
   intercom({
     action: "send",
     to: "<dotfiles session name>",
     message: "[self-improvement] <one-line summary>\n\n" +
              "<free-form body>\n\n" +
              "Origin:\n" +
              "- session: <name>\n" +
              "- cwd: <cwd>\n" +
              "- git: <remote> @ <branch>\n" +
              "- timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD Day HH:MM>\n" +
              "- sender: <human|agent>\n",
     attachments: [/* optional transcript snippets */]
   })
   ```
   The `[self-improvement]` prefix in the first line is what the
   dotfiles-side triage routine matches on to recognise the
   message as feedback.
5. Return immediately. Do **not** block on triage; the dotfiles
   session will reply asynchronously with the new task UUID and
   a "plan now or backlog?" prompt that lands in this session's
   inbox. When that prompt arrives, treat it like any other
   user-visible message.

### Spawn recipe (Flow B fallback)

When no dotfiles session is alive, spawn one. Prefer `cmux`,
fall back to `tmux`, mirroring the conventions in
[`pi-intercom`](../../../.cache/npm/lib/node_modules/pi-intercom/skills/pi-intercom/SKILL.md):

```bash
# cmux preferred — visible split:
cmux new-split right
sleep 0.5
cmux send --surface right "cd $HOME/dotfiles && pi\n"

# tmux fallback:
SOCKET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pi-tmux-sockets
mkdir -p "$SOCKET_DIR"
SOCKET="$SOCKET_DIR/pi.sock"
SESSION=dotfiles-feedback
tmux -S "$SOCKET" new -d -s "$SESSION" -c "$HOME/dotfiles" 'pi'
```

After spawn, poll `intercom action: list` (a few times, ~1 s
apart) until the new session registers, then send. If the
session never registers within a small retry budget, surface the
failure clearly to the user — do *not* silently drop the
feedback.

## Triage routine

Same routine for project-local entries (run in the originating
session) and for dotfiles inbound messages (run in the dotfiles
session).

1. **Parse** the envelope (or local-call args) → body +
   metadata + sender type.
2. **Classify affected target.** Identify the artefact the
   feedback is about and produce a single org tag of the form:
   - `:skill_<name>:` — a specific skill (`:skill_org-tasks:`).
   - `:ext_<name>:` — a pi extension (`:ext_jira:`).
   - `:agents-md:` — root or project `AGENTS.md`.
   - `:prompt_<name>:` — a named prompt.
   - `:project-convention:` — a project-only convention with no
     dedicated artefact yet.
   - `:tier-unknown:` — only when routing was ambiguous (see
     above).
   If multiple targets apply, attach multiple tags.
3. **Dedupe.** Search open entries under `* Agent feedback` in
   the *target* `TASKS.org` for near-duplicates: same target tag
   *and* significant keyword overlap with the new summary. If a
   match exists, append the new evidence (a new dated bullet in
   that entry's body, plus any new attachments quoted verbatim)
   *instead* of creating a parallel TODO. Tell the user / sender
   which existing UUID was extended.
4. **Draft summary + body** using the entry conventions below.
5. **Confirm** wording with the user *only when sender is
   `human`*. Show the proposed summary, body, tags, and target
   `TASKS.org` path; ask for thumbs up / edits before insertion.
   When sender is `agent`, skip confirmation — the entry is the
   agent's own observation, no human is on the sender end to
   confirm wording.
6. **Insert** via `tasks_insert_task` with:
   ```
   file: <target>/TASKS.org
   section: "Agent feedback"
   allowCreateSection: true
   summary: <draft summary>
   labels: [<target tags from step 2>]
   body: <draft body — see entry conventions>
   ```
7. **Acknowledge.** Tell the sender:
   - For local triage: prompt the user inline ("Filed as <UUID>.
     Plan now or backlog?").
   - For cross-tier triage in the dotfiles session: send back
     via `intercom action: send` (or `action: reply` if the
     inbound was an `ask`, though the standard flow uses `send`)
     to the originating session: *"[self-improvement] Filed as
     <UUID> in dotfiles/TASKS.org. Plan now or backlog?"*

## `* Agent feedback` entry conventions

### Heading

```
** TODO [#?] <one-line summary> :<target-tag>:
```

Priority cookie is optional and usually omitted at filing time;
add it during planning if useful.

### Body template

```
<free-form description from sender>

Origin:
- session: <name>
- cwd: <cwd>
- git: <remote> @ <branch>
- timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD Day HH:MM]
- sender: <human|agent>

Evidence:
<optional transcript snippet, quoted verbatim in a src block,
omitted if not useful>
```

When triage merges new evidence into an existing entry, append a
fresh `Origin:` + `Evidence:` block (with its own timestamp) to
the existing body rather than overwriting.

### Promotion to a change-record

When the entry is ready to be planned, follow the standard
`org-plan` flow: a change-record under the target repo's
`#+DEFAULT_PLAN_DIR` (defaults to `[[file:./design/log]]`),
linked from the task via `#+IMPORT:`. Nothing about this skill
short-circuits that flow.

## Worked example

A user in `~/code/some-project` corrects the agent's misuse of
`tasks_insert_task` (the agent forgot `allowCreateSection`).
Tracing back, the AGENTS.md guideline for `tasks_insert_task` is
unclear. The agent self-proposes:

1. Classify tier: `AGENTS.md` snippet lives in
   `$HOME/dotfiles/agents/AGENTS.md` → **global**.
2. Discover dotfiles session via `intercom action: list`. None
   alive → spawn via `cmux` recipe.
3. Send envelope:
   ```
   [self-improvement] AGENTS.md guidance on tasks_insert_task
   misses allowCreateSection requirement

   The current snippet shows tasks_insert_task usage but doesn't
   call out that section creation requires
   allowCreateSection: true. I just hit this in some-project and
   so did the user (they had to remind me).

   Origin:
   - session: some-project
   - cwd: /Users/cormacc/code/some-project
   - git: git@github.com:user/some-project.git @ main
   - timestamp: [2026-04-29 Wed 10:15]
   - sender: agent
   ```
4. Originating session returns immediately and continues the
   user's actual task.
5. Dotfiles session receives, parses, classifies tag
   `:agents-md:`, finds no near-duplicate, drafts summary +
   body, sees sender is `agent` → skips confirmation, inserts
   into `~/dotfiles/TASKS.org` under `* Agent feedback`.
6. Dotfiles session replies via `intercom action: send` to the
   originating session: *"[self-improvement] Filed as
   01234567-… in dotfiles/TASKS.org. Plan now or backlog?"*
7. The originating-session agent surfaces that prompt to the
   user when convenient.
